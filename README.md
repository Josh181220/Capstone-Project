# Capstone-Project
This is a repository for the notebooks used in our Capstone Project in Optimizing Energy Usage in Train Operations

# Our Main Challenges
These are the challenges specified by CAF that we tackled as part of our project, focusing on improving efficiency and sustainability in train operations.

Re-use braking energy:
Which geographical locations are most likely to reuse braking energy?
Are there times when there is a greater opportunity to re-use the braking energy?
Reduce out-of-service energy:
Which equipment/trains have an "anomalous" consumption?

# Methodology
To tackle these challenges, we used a combination of data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques. The code and analysis used to address these objectives are available in the accompanying Jupyter notebooks.
